					<b> What will you be doing?</b>
					<p>
						<br />
						You will participate in a crash course for social entrepreneurship organized by MPowered Entrepreneurship along with cultural exposure to Swahili and what life is like in Kenya throughout the winter semester.
						<br />
						<br />
						During 3 weeks in Kenya in June, you will go through idea generation, market research, pivoting, prototyping, and business model generation in partnership with young adults from the Kithoka and surrounding Meru community. 
						<br />
						<br />
						The trip will conclude with a pitch of your idea to influential local leaders in the Kenyan community to receive feedback and determine future viability and funding.
						<br />
						<br />
						After your return to campus in the fall, you will re-pitch the idea to a panel of UM professors, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists to receive feedback. From there, you can decide to take the initiative to continue working on the project and apply to resources like Techarb or a social entrepreneurship practicum course at UM. Or, you can pass off the idea to a local entrepreneur incubator we partner with where a Kenyan will take over operations and build the idea into a business to improve the economy in Kenya.

						<b>Lodging</b>
						<p>
							<br>You will be staying at the Thiiri Center, a community-cultural center with modern amenities.    
						</p>
						<b>Immunizations</b>
						<p>
							<br>The Center for Disease Control website contains important information for traveling to Kenya.  The CDC recommends visiting a travel clinic four to six weeks in advance of your trip.  The University Health Service (UHS) travel clinic is a very simple and convenient option.  Malaria risk is present in Kithoka, Kenya.
							Clinics and full service hospitals are located within a one hour drive of our project locations and our hosts at the Thiiri Center are familiar with the local medical resources.
						</p>
						<b>Costs</b>
						<p>
						<br>Costs will depend on the amount we fundraise.  Last year, MPowered covered all costs of living and staying in Kenya, while trip participants paid for their plane ticket, personal immunizations, and visas. 
						If you have financial concerns about your ability to participate, don't let it hold you back. Feel free to reach out to us at mpowered-kenya@umich.edu, and we will do our best to support you.
